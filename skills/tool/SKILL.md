# Agent Factory Tool

- `<plugin-root>` is the installed Agent Factory plugin directory that contains `skills/`,
  `runtime/` and `scripts/`; it is two levels above this `SKILL.md`.
- This is a catalog only. Before running a tool, follow the owning Skill's rules; they
  remain the single source for authority and failure handling.
- Run every tool as `python3 <plugin-root>/scripts/<script> ...`.
- Each script name links to its usage file with subcommands and arguments, generated from
  its `--help`. Read only the file (and subcommand section) for the tool you will run.
