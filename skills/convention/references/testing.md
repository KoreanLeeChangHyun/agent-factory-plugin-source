# Testing Convention

- Use this reference before authoring or changing tests, and when organizing, selecting, or running them.

<a id="source-organization"></a>

## 1. Source organization

<a id="layout-rules"></a>

### 1.1. Layout rules

- Use `tests/` as the test root.
- Group tests into meaningful subdirectories by purpose or owning component.
- Do not accumulate tests directly under `tests/` or classify them only by filename
  prefixes.
- Keep runner configuration and shared discovery hooks at the root when the framework
  requires it.
- Extend an existing category before creating another.
- Update collection and imports when moving files.

<a id="collection"></a>

### 1.2. Collection

- Follow the project runner’s test naming and discovery rules.
  Keep helpers outside collected test modules.
- Configure shared import paths once; avoid duplicated path/bootstrap code.
- Remove tests for retired domains/deleted Human document packages.
- Test maintained ownership and observable behavior, not generated prose wording.

<a id="test-authoring"></a>

### 1.3. Test authoring

- Treat full-suite execution cost as a design constraint when adding tests. Do not
  create a new test merely because code changed or to increase the test count.
- First inspect existing coverage. Extend an existing case or parameterize distinct
  inputs when that captures missing behavior without repeating expensive setup.
- Test meaningful observable behavior, regression risks, boundaries and failure paths.
  Prefer the lowest-cost test layer that can detect the actual defect.
- Avoid assertions that duplicate implementation or match incidental source text,
  private names, formatting or generated prose. Check exact text only when it is itself
  the maintained public contract.
- Preserve real integration coverage where mocks would hide filesystem, process,
  network or browser defects. Do not repeat full integration setup for every pure-logic
  input variation.
- Use the smallest fixture that exercises the condition. Keep benchmark workloads
  separate from ordinary correctness cases unless scale is essential to the regression.
- Do not add tests for reversible, low-impact edits without a concrete regression risk.
  Preserve existing meaningful coverage and failure visibility.

### 1.4. Preparation and waits

- Reuse immutable build outputs, parsed templates and expensive read-only setup within
  an appropriate runner or fixture scope. Avoid compiling the same source per case.
- Keep mutable application state, temporary repositories and runtime homes isolated.
  Shared preparation must not introduce dependencies on test execution order.
- Keep caches local to a test invocation unless input/dependency invalidation is
  explicitly implemented and checked. Faster runs must still exercise changed code.
- For timer logic, use controllable clocks or supported fake timers instead of actual
  sleeps. Restore mocks after each test and check the project's runner version.
- For real asynchronous integration, await the required event or observable condition
  with a bounded timeout. Do not replace filesystem/process completion with fake time
  or shorten timeouts solely to claim a speedup.
- In browser tests, prefer locators and condition-based assertions with automatic waiting
  over fixed sleeps. Reuse browser startup where supported while isolating test contexts.
- Arrange independent slow groups so the runner can distribute them. Avoid many tiny
  test processes when startup would dominate the work.

## 2. Focused execution

- Run only the smallest relevant test set for the owning component and affected
  contract.
- Resolve it from the project's established runner and current test layout; do not treat
  one framework or command as universal.
- Treat the interpreter and dependency environment as part of that runner. Before
  execution, inspect repository evidence such as environment directories, tool
  configuration, dependency files and CI setup; do not assume the system-default Python
  contains the project's test dependencies.
- Run an exact Human-supplied command unchanged first.
  - If it fails before collection because its interpreter lacks the runner or
    dependencies, make no installation change unless authorized.
  - Resolve an existing compatible project environment and retry the same test scope and
    options through that environment.
  - Report the initial infrastructure failure separately from the retry result.
- Never encode a development sibling's environment path as a durable repository command.
  An evidenced adjacent shared environment may be used only as a local execution
  fallback when its compatibility is checked for the selected test.
- Before attributing a failure to the change, reproduce the same check against the
  unchanged baseline (for example a temporary copy of `HEAD`). Report failures that
  also occur on the baseline separately as pre-existing, and do not repair unrelated
  product code or shared tests outside the task's scope to make them pass.
- Broaden only when focused evidence demonstrates cross-domain impact or the Human
  explicitly requests broader coverage.
- Run a full suite only on explicit Human request.

## 3. Parallel execution and speed

- When optimizing tests, measure collection, setup, execution and teardown before
  changing the runner. Use duration reports or profiling to locate expensive paths.
- Compare the same scope and environment across repeated runs. Record wall time,
  outcomes and cache/worker settings. Do not remove assertions, skip slow cases or
  hide failures to improve timing.
- For an authorized full suite, prefer the runner's process-based parallel execution
  after checking that tests isolate mutable state. Keep small focused runs serial when
  worker startup would cost more than it saves.
- Isolate runtime homes, temporary files, databases, ports, and subprocess ownership per
  worker or test. Sequence cases that must share an external resource; do not remove
  assertions or hide failures to make parallel runs pass.
- Bound worker count to the available CPU, memory, and child-process load. Compare
  elapsed time and outcomes on the same suite and environment before claiming a speedup;
  preserve a serial command for diagnosis.
- Parallel execution does not expand test authorization or enable opt-in external
  integrations automatically.

<a id="agent-graph-boundary"></a>

## 4. Agent graph boundary

- Organizing/authoring tests grants no execution authority. Within the bounded request,
  Work performs necessary own checks and records commands/results or reasons not run.
  These checks never substitute for independent Verification in verification modes.
  Main performs own checks in direct mode only; for delegated work Main acknowledges
  the bound result/receipt and reports without reviewing implementation or rerunning tests.
  Plan-only returns its plan without implementation or execution checks.
- Verification independently checks exact Work with the smallest authorized tests.
- Report skipped/unrun tests honestly, never as passes.
