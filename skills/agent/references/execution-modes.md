# Execution modes

<a id="captured-routes"></a>

## 1. Captured routes

| Mode | Implementation | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `direct` (new Main input default) | Main directly | Appropriate Main checks |
| `work` | Managed Work | Completed Work Goal and receipt with own checks; separate Verification not requested |
| `plan` | Actual Work Plan collaboration mode only | Return plan; no execution or Verification |
| `verification` | Managed standalone Verification | Request-bound standalone receipt and findings; no repairs |
| `plan-work` | Actual Plan then default execution in the same Work thread | Completed Work Goal and receipt with own checks; separate Verification not requested |
| `work-verification` | Managed Work | Separate Verification pass or evidenced Human skip |
| `plan-work-verification` | Actual Plan then default execution in the same Work thread | Separate Verification pass or evidenced Human skip |

- Conversation and Human Interview always remain Main.
- Selecting a mode does not satisfy the independent Human approval gate or expand
  execution permissions.
- Composer actions send the current draft through Main immediately and are never persisted.
  Ordinary Enter/send always captures direct, even after restoring old saved modes.
  Queued messages retain their action; different actions must never merge.
- Main preserves an active task's route when handling conversational steering.

## 2. Runtime interface

- `exec.py submit/send --task-mode MODE` snapshots the route. New Main requests without a flag capture `direct`;
  persisted runs with no mode use `work-verification`. Explicit flags participate in the
  immutable dispatch tuple.
- Main performs `direct` work itself; do not create a direct-mode loop.
- `loop.py start --task-mode work --work-agent ID --request-file PATH` (also `--task-mode plan-work`) needs no Verification identity. Its completed Work
  receipt ends the loop with terminal reason `work-completed`. Main acknowledges the bound result/receipt and reports without reviewing implementation
  or rerunning checks.
- Work-bound verification modes additionally require `--verification-agent ID`. Failure revises the same Work
  session, then reuses the same Verification session and binds its receipt to the new
  exact Work run. No planning role or extra Agent exists.
- The low-level loop CLI's omitted flag retains `work-verification` for existing callers.
  Persisted loops without the field use `work-verification`. New Main uses its captured mode
  explicitly when starting a loop.
- `capabilities` version 0.1.0 exposes `submit/send.taskModes`. Clients require the selected mode in
  that list before dispatch; absence is unsupported, never an invitation to inject prose
  or silently choose another route. Existing fields and receipt schema versions remain
  compatible.

## 3. Actual Plan transition

- `plan`, `plan-work` and `plan-work-verification` require advertised Plan support.
- The runtime plans and executes within the same exact Work session, preserving model,
  reasoning, permissions and approval policy.
- The plan is retained as `plan.json`. In `plan` mode the host stops after the actual Plan turn,
  records a read-only Work completion receipt (no project changes or tests), and returns
  the plan. Other Plan routes require implementation before Work completion.
- No transition click is required.
- An unresolved required Human decision returns `needs-human-decision`.
- Failure or interruption cannot start implementation or Verification.
- Missing Plan support fails before a model turn; do not imitate the transition in prose.
- For Plan·Work routes, completed implementation and a valid Work receipt are required.
- `plan-work` completes with Work own checks; `plan-work-verification` requires separate Verification.

<a id="reports-and-authority"></a>

## 4. Reports and authority

- Use `not requested` for separate Verification in direct/work/plan-work modes, not
  `pass` or Human skip.
- Report Main's own checks for direct and Work-reported own checks for delegated work separately
  from independent Verification. Status and receipt identity checks do not re-verify work.
- Work performs necessary own checks but never claims independent Verification pass or commits.
- Permission, approval, publication and destructive-action authority remain independent
  of mode.
- Mode selection alone sends no messages to external services.


<a id="standalone-verification-and-planning"></a>

## 5. Standalone verification and planning

- Main resolves a standalone verification target from explicit input first, then prior
  completed work in this chat. Missing or ambiguous targets require a Human answer;
  never fabricate a Work ID or evidence.
- Dispatch `exec.py submit --role verification --task-mode verification --agent ID --request-file PATH`.
  The bounded request identifies the exact target and authorized checks. Do not supply
  `--verified-work-run-id` or `--receipt-request-hash`. Sends to this verifier also use
  `--task-mode verification` explicitly.
- `standalone-verification-receipt` binds `runId` and `requestHash` of this target request,
  with `decision` and `findings`; it contains no Work binding and cannot close a Work loop.
  Work-bound receipts and loop fix/recheck transitions keep their existing contracts.
- Plan alone dispatches `exec.py submit --role work --task-mode plan`; it does not create
  a loop or substitute literal `/plan` text for collaboration mode. Plan·Work routes
  continue using loop.py and the same Work session for Plan/default turns.
- Historical runs and omitted legacy loop routes retain their original meaning.

<a id="role-specific-model-overrides"></a>

## 6. Role-specific model overrides

- `loop.py start` accepts `--work-model`, `--work-reasoning-effort`,
  `--verification-model`, and `--verification-reasoning-effort`. These overrides
  are captured with the loop and passed to both initial and revision turns for
  that role. Plan uses the same Work profile. The existing `--model` remains a
  shared fallback for initial submissions when no role model is supplied.
- For standalone `exec.py submit/send`, use `--model` and `--reasoning-effort`.
- Model settings do not change execution authority or add an agent to the route.

## 7. Execution providers

- Historical sessions remain Codex sessions. `--model claude-opus`, `claude-sonnet`,
  or `claude-haiku` selects Claude Code's corresponding alias. Full `claude-*`
  model IDs such as `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-fable-5-1` and
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` pass through unchanged; account access is checked by Claude at execution.
- `exec.py submit` accepts `--provider codex|claude|antigravity`, `--claude <executable>` and
  `--agy <executable>`.
  `send` preserves the captured executable and provider unless an unstarted or
  explicitly cleared conversation selects another provider. Never pass a Codex
  session ID to Claude, or vice versa. Existing run history is retained.
- `capabilities --model <model>` reports the selected provider before submission.
  Do not infer Claude capabilities from Codex's app-server schema.
- Claude supports every task mode. Fast is accepted as a no-op; Goal uses Claude's `/goal`
  (see [Native Fast and Goal](native-fast-goal.md#claude-goal)). Plan runs in Claude's `plan`
  permission mode; plan-work routes then resume the same session to execute the approved plan.
- Execution policies map to the nearest Claude permission mode, always with
  `--permission-prompts none`:

  | Policy | Claude permission mode |
  |---|---|
  | `danger-full-access` | `bypassPermissions` |
  | `workspace-write` | `acceptEdits`, extra writable roots as `--add-dir` |
  | `read-only` | `dontAsk` |

  Claude tool permissions are not an OS sandbox: network access is not confined. Without an
  explicit policy (CLI default), `permissions.defaultMode` from the user, project and local
  Claude settings selects the policy; an unset or other mode maps to `read-only`.
- Claude effort values are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. `minimal` maps to
  `low`, `ultra` to `max`, and `none` leaves Claude's default effort.
- Claude child runs load the user's Claude settings, hooks, tool servers and CLAUDE.md.
  Each run records `contextUsage` (latest prompt size and context window) in its state.

<a id="antigravity"></a>

### 7.1. Antigravity

- The Antigravity CLI (`agy`) runs Google AI subscription models in print mode. `gemini-*`
  models select it. Name its other models `antigravity/<id>` (for example
  `antigravity/claude-sonnet-4-6`) or pass `--provider antigravity` with the plain `<id>`;
  a plain `claude-*` model always selects Claude Code.
- Runs use the `agent-factory` custom agent, which the runtime writes to
  `~/.gemini/config/agents/agent-factory/agent.md`. It replaces agy's default system prompt and
  keeps only file, shell, web, image generation and `finish` tools; project rules (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) still
  apply, and the user's agy tool servers are not loaded.
- Every task mode and Goal are supported; Fast is a no-op and images are rejected (text only).
  Plan runs by instruction without skipped permissions, because agy's `plan` mode waits for review.
- Policies map to agy permissions, which are not an OS sandbox:

  | Policy | agy permissions |
  |---|---|
  | `danger-full-access` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
  | `workspace-write` | default; extra writable roots as `--add-dir` |
  | `read-only` | default, with a read-only instruction |

  The default denies commands and reads outside the workspace, run directory and Agent Factory
  Skills, and allows
  workspace edits even under `read-only`. A denied call ends the turn without a result, so
  the run fails. The CLI default policy is `workspace-write`.
- `--effort` applies to agy's default model and base IDs such as `gemini-3.8-flash`; IDs
  ending in a level (`-low`, `-medium`, `-high`) fix their effort, and other families ignore it.
  A level the model does not offer (`gemini-3.1-pro` has `low` and `high`) uses the nearest one.
  `minimal` maps to `low`, `xhigh` and `ultra` to `max`, and `none` leaves the default.
